# CS50_CrazyAsteroids
- I have created this little game where astronaut Ripley must reach the spaceship to escape from a field of crazy asteroids using arrow keys.
- The required variable is the name of the player, to whom Ripley will turn to ask for help using their name.
- At the start of the game, the oxygen variable begins to decrease; Ripley can replenish oxygen by touching one of the two balloons drifting in space.
- When the oxygen reaches 0, the game ends.
- Additionally, if an asteroid touches Ripley or the ship, damage is counted, which, once it reaches a maximum of 100, will end the game.
- 9 sprites and three backdrops were used (one for the game, one for victory, and one for game over).
- A custom block inserted in the asteroid scripts was also used.![image](https://github.com/fnaOnGitub/CS50_CrazyAsteroids/assets/24286901/ac27daa3-573a-4ef4-bbd4-5e84fc2ee7ee)
